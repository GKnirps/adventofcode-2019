Advent of Code 2019
===================

These are solutions for the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).
All solutions so far have been written in rust.

There is also an intcode library, though the implementation got rather messy and would
need refactoring if I was planning to use it for more than just this challenge.

I did not publish the intcode library on crates.io so far.
